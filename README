This is a Django project template that allows you to use the database component
of Django without having to use the rest of Django (i.e. running a web server).

Now you can write regular python scripts and use Django's excellent database
functionality. Developed on Python 2.7. Not tested on other versions.

QUICK SETUP:

1.) Inside project/manage.py - Edit the path to the project folder
2.) Inside project/settings.py - Edit your database settings
3.) Inside project/myscript.py - Edit the path and database settings
4.) Inside db/models.py - Setup your models

myscript.py is the file where you start coding your project. Think of it like a
plain old python file, but now with the power of Django's database functionality!
